## config

#### cursor color

The color of the cursor can be changed in the package's settings panel. As of `v0.3.0` there are two colors, to allow for blinking between two colors (instead of blinking on and off).
Note for those that want a blink-on-blink-off cursor: You can't set the cursor color to transparent from the settings tab. You will have to do this by editing `~/.atom/config.cson`.

#### cursor pulse

As of v0.4.0 there's an option, `enablePulse`, that makes the cursor pulsate rather than blink. It is off by default.
